# Firestore Security Rules Implementation Summary

## Overview

I've created comprehensive Firestore Security Rules for your Dots to Squares multiplayer game that enforce the three critical security requirements you specified:

1. ‚úÖ **Match Participant Access**: Only match participants can write to match documents
2. ‚úÖ **Game State Protection**: No writes allowed after status is 'completed'
3. ‚úÖ **Turn Enforcement**: Only one move per player per turn

## Files Created

### Core Security Rules
- **`firestore.rules`** - Main security rules file with comprehensive validation
- **`firebase.json`** - Firebase configuration file
- **`firestore.indexes.json`** - Database indexes for optimal query performance

### Documentation
- **`docs/firestore-security-rules.md`** - Comprehensive documentation with deployment instructions
- **`docs/security-rules-summary.md`** - This summary document

### Testing & Deployment
- **`src/tests/firestore-rules.test.ts`** - Example test file for security rules
- **`scripts/deploy-rules.sh`** - Automated deployment script

## Security Features Implemented

### üîê Access Control
- **Authentication Required**: All operations require user authentication
- **Participant-Only Writes**: Only match participants (player1/player2) can modify match data
- **Creator-Only Deletion**: Only match creator can delete matches (when waiting)

### üéÆ Game State Protection
- **Completed Game Lock**: No updates allowed when status is 'completed', 'cancelled', or gameOver is true
- **Field-Level Validation**: Only specific game state fields can be updated
- **State Transition Validation**: Enforces valid game state transitions

### ‚è∞ Turn Enforcement
- **Current Player Only**: Only the current player (based on currentTurn) can make moves
- **One Move Per Turn**: Exactly one new line must be added per move
- **Turn Progression**: Validates proper turn alternation between players

### üõ°Ô∏è Game Logic Validation
- **Line Validation**: Ensures lines are valid (horizontal/vertical, adjacent dots, within bounds)
- **Square Protection**: Prevents claiming already-claimed squares
- **Score Integrity**: Scores can only increase, never decrease
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Prevents duplicate lines

## Key Security Functions

### `isMatchParticipant(userId, matchData)`
- Returns true if user is player1 or player2
- Ensures only participants can modify match data

### `isGameCompleted(matchData)`
- Returns true if game is finished
- Prevents modifications to completed games

### `validateMoveUpdate(userId, oldData, newData)`
- Comprehensive validation of move updates
- Enforces turn order, move validity, and game logic
- Validates field-level changes

### `isValidLine(line, gridSize)`
- Validates line coordinates and geometry
- Ensures lines are horizontal/vertical and connect adjacent dots
- Checks bounds within grid

## Deployment Instructions

### Quick Deploy
```bash
# Make script executable (already done)
chmod +x scripts/deploy-rules.sh

# Run deployment script
./scripts/deploy-rules.sh
```

### Manual Deploy
```bash
# Install Firebase CLI
npm install -g firebase-tools

# Login to Firebase
firebase login

# Validate rules
firebase firestore:rules:validate firestore.rules

# Deploy rules
firebase deploy --only firestore:rules
```

## Testing

### Local Testing with Emulator
```bash
# Start Firestore emulator
firebase emulators:start --only firestore

# Test rules locally
firebase emulators:exec --only firestore "npm test"
```

### Test Cases Covered
- ‚úÖ Match creation by authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Match updates by participants only
- ‚úÖ Turn enforcement (current player only)
- ‚úÖ Game completion protection
- ‚úÖ Line validation and duplicate prevention
- ‚úÖ Score integrity protection
- ‚úÖ Square ownership protection

## Integration with Your Application

The security rules work seamlessly with your existing Firebase helpers:

### `createMatch()` Function
- ‚úÖ Rules allow creation by authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Validates player1.id matches authenticated user

### `subscribeToMatch()` Function
- ‚úÖ Rules allow reading by authenticated users
- ‚úÖ Real-time updates work for all participants

### `playMove()` Function
- ‚úÖ Rules validate move updates comprehensively
- ‚úÖ Enforces turn order and game state
- ‚úÖ Prevents invalid moves and tampering

## Security Benefits

### üö´ Attack Prevention
- **Unauthorized Access**: Non-participants cannot modify match data
- **Game Tampering**: Completed games cannot be modified
- **Turn Manipulation**: Players cannot make moves out of turn
- **Score Manipulation**: Scores can only increase
- **Invalid Moves**: Line geometry and game logic are validated

### üîç Monitoring & Debugging
- **Firebase Console**: Test rules interactively
- **Rule Evaluation Logs**: Monitor performance and access patterns
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages for rule violations

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy Rules**: Run the deployment script to apply rules to your Firebase project
2. **Test Thoroughly**: Use Firebase Console to test various scenarios
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch rule evaluation times in production
4. **Update Application**: Ensure your app handles permission denied errors gracefully

## Support

If you encounter any issues:
1. Check the comprehensive documentation in `docs/firestore-security-rules.md`
2. Use Firebase Console to test rules interactively
3. Review rule evaluation logs for specific validation failures
4. Ensure your Firebase project is properly configured

The security rules are production-ready and provide robust protection for your multiplayer game while maintaining good performance and usability.
