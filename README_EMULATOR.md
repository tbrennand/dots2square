# Firebase Emulator Testing Guide

This guide covers how to test the Dots to Squares multiplayer game using Firebase Emulator for real-time synchronization and match completion logic.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Start Firebase Emulator

```bash
npm run emulator:start
```

This starts:
- **Firestore Emulator** on port 8080
- **Auth Emulator** on port 9099  
- **Emulator UI** on port 4000

### 2. Run Automated Test

```bash
npm run emulator:test
```

This runs a complete 2-player match simulation that tests all game logic.

### 3. Full Test (Start Emulator + Run Test)

```bash
npm run emulator:full
```

This automatically starts the emulator and runs the test after a 5-second delay.

## üéÆ Manual Testing

### 1. Start Development Server

In one terminal:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### 2. Start Firebase Emulator

In another terminal:
```bash
npm run emulator:start
```

### 3. Access Test Interface

Navigate to `http://localhost:5173/emulator-test` to access the visual test interface.

### 4. Test Multiplayer Flow

1. **Create Match:** Click "Create Test Match"
2. **Join Match:** Click "Join as Player 2" 
3. **Play Game:** Select moves and click "Play Move"
4. **Run Simulation:** Click "Run Full Simulation" for automated testing
5. **Observe Sync:** Watch real-time updates in the interface

## üìä What Gets Tested

### Real-time Synchronization
- ‚úÖ Match creation and joining
- ‚úÖ Live updates across multiple clients
- ‚úÖ Turn management and validation
- ‚úÖ Score calculation and updates
- ‚úÖ Game state changes

### Game Logic
- ‚úÖ Line validation and claiming
- ‚úÖ Square completion detection
- ‚úÖ Chain turns (extra turns for completing squares)
- ‚úÖ Game completion and winner determination
- ‚úÖ Error handling for invalid moves

### Firebase Integration
- ‚úÖ Firestore transactions for atomicity
- ‚úÖ Real-time listeners and subscriptions
- ‚úÖ Security rules enforcement
- ‚úÖ Data consistency and integrity

## üîß Test Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Basic 2-Player Match
**Objective:** Test complete game flow from creation to completion

**Steps:**
1. Create match with Player 1
2. Join match with Player 2
3. Play moves alternately
4. Complete squares and verify scoring
5. Finish game and determine winner

**Expected Results:**
- Real-time synchronization between players
- Correct turn management
- Accurate square completion detection
- Proper score calculation
- Game completion with winner

### Scenario 2: Chain Turns
**Objective:** Test that completing a square gives the player another turn

**Steps:**
1. Set up a position where Player 1 can complete a square
2. Player 1 draws the line to complete the square
3. Verify Player 1 gets another turn
4. Continue until no more squares can be completed

**Expected Results:**
- Player gets additional turn after completing square
- Turn switches only when no square is completed

### Scenario 3: Concurrent Moves
**Objective:** Test handling of simultaneous moves

**Steps:**
1. Both players try to make moves at the same time
2. Verify only one move succeeds
3. Check that the other move is rejected

**Expected Results:**
- Only one move per turn is allowed
- Invalid moves are rejected with appropriate error messages

### Scenario 4: Game Completion
**Objective:** Test end-game conditions

**Steps:**
1. Play until all squares are completed
2. Verify game status changes to 'complete'
3. Check winner determination
4. Verify no more moves can be made

**Expected Results:**
- Game status updates to 'complete'
- Winner is correctly determined
- Further moves are rejected

## üìà Monitoring and Debugging

### Firebase Emulator UI
Access the emulator UI at `http://localhost:4000` to:
- View Firestore data in real-time
- Monitor authentication state
- Debug security rules
- Export/import test data

### Console Logging
The test script provides detailed logging:
- Match creation and joining
- Move validation and processing
- Real-time updates
- Game state changes
- Error conditions

### Browser Developer Tools
Use browser dev tools to:
- Monitor network requests
- Check console for errors
- Debug Vue component state
- Verify Pinia store updates

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Emulator Connection Failed**
   ```
   Error: Failed to connect to Firestore emulator
   ```
   **Solution:** Ensure emulator is running on correct ports

2. **Permission Denied**
   ```
   Error: Missing or insufficient permissions
   ```
   **Solution:** Check Firestore security rules in `firestore.rules`

3. **Real-time Updates Not Working**
   ```
   No updates received from Firestore
   ```
   **Solution:** Verify `subscribeToMatch()` is called correctly

4. **Move Validation Errors**
   ```
   Error: Not your turn
   ```
   **Solution:** Check turn management logic and current player state

### Debug Commands

```bash
# Check emulator status
firebase emulators:status

# View emulator logs
firebase emulators:start --only firestore --debug

# Reset emulator data
firebase emulators:start --import=./test-data --export-on-exit=./test-data
```

## üìã Test Data Structure
