# Audio Files

## Countdown Sound

Place your countdown sound file here as `countdown.mp3`.

### Requirements:
- **Filename**: Must be exactly `countdown.mp3`
- **Duration**: Should be 5 seconds long (to match the timer countdown)
- **Format**: MP3 format for best browser compatibility
- **Volume**: The app will automatically set volume to 60%

### Suggested Sound:
You can use:
- A simple beep that repeats every second for 5 seconds
- A ticking clock sound
- A gentle chime or bell countdown
- Any 5-second audio clip you prefer

### Example Sources:
- Generate a countdown sound using online audio generators
- Record your own 5-second countdown
- Use free sound effects from sites like Freesound.org
- Create a simple beep sequence using audio editing software

The sound will automatically play when the timer reaches 5 seconds remaining on any player's turn.
